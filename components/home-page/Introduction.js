            Elevating women’s fitness with mindful support and community.

          <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
            We are on a mission to create something truly special – a women's
            fitness community that goes beyond workouts and embraces the power
            of sisterhood.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
            Too often, we encountered judgment, unrealistic standards, and a
            sense of inadequacy that left us feeling discouraged and
            disconnected in our fitness journeys.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
            Starting Pace Fitness has been a labour of love, born out of a
            desire to provide a space where women can thrive, support each
            other, and prioritise their mental health alongside their physical
            well-being. In this community, we uplift and inspire one another,
            celebrating our unique strengths and journeys so that each
            individual can grow at her own pace.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-3 text-lg">
            Pace Fitness is not just about fitness; it's about fostering a sense
            of belonging, empowerment, and growth. Together, we are redefining
            what it means to be a strong and united community of women.
